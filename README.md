# Smart-Energy-Predictive-Modeling-for-Optimized-Consumption-in-Urban-environments
This project aims to develop a predictive model for energy consumption in smart cities using time series (using XG Boost and ARIMA) and machine learning regression techniques. By analyzing historical data, the model provides accurate forecasts of future energy demand, which supports optimized resource allocation and energy management.
Explainable AI techniques like LIME and SHAP were used to identify key factors influencing predictions, enhancing transparency and actionable insights for better decision- making.  Key features, including weather conditions, holidays, and time-related patterns, were integrated to enhance prediction accuracy. A combination of statistical and machine learning models was evaluated, showing significant improvements in capturing complex consumption patterns. This approach enables more efficient planning and resource use, with potential applications in real-time energy monitoring and adaptive management in smart cities.
