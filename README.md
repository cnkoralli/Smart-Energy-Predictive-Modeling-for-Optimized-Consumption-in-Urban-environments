# 🔋 Smart Energy Predictive Modeling for Optimized Consumption in Urban Environments

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project builds a **predictive model** to forecast energy consumption in smart cities using **time series models** (like XGBoost and ARIMA) and **machine learning regression techniques**. It helps optimize resource allocation, plan energy supply, and enhance urban sustainability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Accurately forecast short-term and long-term **energy demand**.
- Use **Explainable AI (XAI)** (e.g., LIME, SHAP) to interpret model decisions.
- Enable **smart planning** for utilities, especially during high demand periods.
- Improve energy management using **weather, time, and event-based patterns**.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Integrated **weather data**, **public holidays**, and **temporal trends**.
- ✅ Combined **ARIMA** (for trend/seasonality) with **XGBoost** (for nonlinear patterns).
- ✅ Applied **LIME and SHAP** to explain model predictions.
- ✅ Tested and evaluated multiple models to achieve optimal performance.
- ✅ Real-time adaptation potential for **smart grid applications**.
